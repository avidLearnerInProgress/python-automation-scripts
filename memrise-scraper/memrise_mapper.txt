He mentions in it only one previous enterprise of the same kind (though there had in fact been others) - that, namely, of Nicholas Francois Canard (c. 1750-1833 ), whose book, Principes d'economie politique (Paris, 1802), was crowned by the French Academy, though "its principles were radically false as well as erroneously applied."
!-------------------!

canon => an established set of principles; a basis or standard for judgment; a group of literary works
In one sense tt may be said to stand to theological literature in Scotland in something of the same position as that occupied by the Canon Mirificus with respect to the scientific literature, for it is the first published original work relating to theological interpretation, and is quite without a predecessor in its own field.
Anne's sister, Mary Boleyn, had been Henry VIII.'s mistress; this by canon law was a bar to his marriage with Anne - a bar which had been removed by papal dispensation in 1527, but now the papal power to dispense in such cases had been repudiated, and the original objection revived.
(1868), by Canon Mason (1897), A.

!-------------------!

captious => faultfinding; intended to entrap, as in an argument
The captious logic of the Megarian school was indeed in some cases closely related to sceptical results.
The most foolish and discreditable was certainly that of Davies; his unworthy attempt to depreciate the great historian's learning, and his captious, cavilling, acrimonious charges of petty inaccuracies and discreditable falsification gave the object of his attack an easy triumph.
The first muttering of the storm which was soon to break was heard in a breve issued in 1741 by Benedict XIV., wherein he denounced the Jesuit offenders as "disobedient, contumacious, captious and reprobate persons," and enacted many stringent regulations for their better government.
!-------------------!

In other words, a categorical universal is often problematic, but a problematic is not the same as a hypothetical judgment.

!-------------------!

causal => involving a cause
The attack made by David Hume on the causal relation led directly to the new rationalism of Kant, who argued that it was wrong to regard thought as mere analysis.
For if we inquire into this causal relation we find that though we know isolated facts, we cannot perceive any such connexion between them as that the one should give rise to the other.
Not, says Wundt, by association, as Hume said, but by thinking; not, however, by a priori thinking, as Kant said, but by logical thinking, by applying the logical principle of ground and consequent (which Leibnitz had called the principle of sufficient reason) as a causal law to empirical appearances.

When a train is running round a curve the centrifugal force which comes into play tends to make its wheel-flanges press against the outer rail, or even to capsize it.
!-------------------!

centripetal => moving or directed toward a center
In a bundle examined in the basal portion of a leaf the bulk of the xylem is found to be centrifugal in position, but internally to the protoxylem there is a group of centripetal tracheids; higher up in the petiole the xylem is mainly centripetal, the centrifugal wood being represented by a small arc of tracheids external to the protoxylem and separated from it by a few parenchymatous elements.
This centripetal force of planets to the sun.

But he spent what small energy he possessed in a wretched strife of chicanery and broken promises with Thomas of Lancaster and his party, dismissing and recalling Gaveston according to the exigencies of the moment, while he let the Scottish war shift for itself.
His chicanery need not, howForeign ever, be censured over much, for the princes with whom i~yVU.

!-------------------!

codify => to systematize
They codify laws regarding libel and slander.
In the 13th century it became necessary for the legists to codify, as it were, the unwritten law, because the upheavals of the times necessitated the fixing of some rules in writing, and especially because it was necessary to oppose a definite custom of the kingdom to Frederick II., who sought, as king of Jerusalem, to take advantage of the want of a written law, to substitute his own conceptions of law in the teeth of the high court.

As so great a part of the whole surface of the kidney lies adjacent to external surfaces of the body, the remaining part which faces the internal organs is small; it consists of the left part of the under surface; it is level with the floor of the pericardium, and lies over the globular mass formed by the liver and convoluted intestine.
There, as above explained, Leach began the subdivision of Muller's too comprehensive genus, the result being that Lynceus belongs to the Phyllopoda, and Chydorus (Leach, 1816) properly gives its name to the present family, in which the doubly convoluted intestine is so remarkable.

frugality => thrift
For the rest, frugality, industry and patience characteffize all the bread-winners; courage and burning patriotism are attributes of the whole nation.

A third with pins in her mouth was running about between the countess and Sonya, and a fourth held the whole of the gossamer garment up high on one uplifted hand.
It was formerly supposed that this custom was peculiar to a single species, which was called the "gossamer" spider from the fact that the floating webs, when brought to the earth by rain or intercepted by bushes and trees, coat the foliage or grass with a sheeting of gossamer-like silk; but the habit is now known to be practised by the newly-hatched young of a great variety of species belonging to several distinct families.

!-------------------!

homily => sermon; tedious moralizing lecture
None of his sermons, however, unless we regard his book on the Lord's Prayer as a homily, has come down to us.
If this appearance be not fallacious, the obvious relation between the two superscriptions will be best explained by the supposition that the author of Jude gave currency to the existing homily (James) before composing under the pseudonym of Jude.
HOMILY, a simple religious address, less elaborate than a sermon, and confining itself to the practical exposition of some ethical topic or some passage of Scripture.
!-------------------!

homogeneous => composed of identical parts; uniform in composition
= 0, we find that, eliminating x, the resultant is a homogeneous function of y and z of degree mn; equating this to zero and solving for the ratio of y to z we obtain mn solutions; if values of y and z, given by any solution, be substituted in each of the two equations, they will possess a common factor which gives a value of x which, corn bined with the chosen values of y and z, yields a system of values which satisfies both equations.
The people who finally abandoned the mainland and took their priests with them are the people who made the Venetian republic. But they were not as yet a homogeneous population.
Consider two binary equations of orders m and n respectively expressed' in non-homogeneous form, viz.

This isn't mere hyperbole.
Hyperbole is unacceptable when speaking in court.
!-------------------!

iconoclastic => attacking cherished traditions
The victory of Christianity - iconoclastic in its primitive spirit - was but a single chapter in the story of decline.
This idea that material representation involves a profanation of divine personages, while disallowing all religious art which goes beyond scroll-work, spirals, flourishes and geometrical designs, yet admits to the full of secular art; and accordingly the iconoclastic emperors replaced the holy pictures in churches with frescoes of hunting scenes, and covered their palaces with garden scenes where men were plucking fruit and birds singing amid the foliage.
The iconoclastic movement is perhaps the most dramatic episode in Byzantine history, and the above outline of its external events must be completed by an appreciation of its deeper historical and religious significance and results.
!-------------------!

idolatry => idol worship; blind or excessive devotion
The idolatry of the nation is pictured in darkest colours.
" High Place," " Idolatry and Primitive Religion."

!-------------------!

imbroglio => complicated situation; an entanglement
The curious imbroglio deceived royalists and republicans alike.
He directed the peace negotiations with Spain after the war of 1898, and not only secured American interests in the imbroglio caused by the Boxers in China, but grasped the opportunity to insist on "the administrative entity" of China; influenced the powers to declare publicly for the "open door".
By sheer tenacity of purpose, Bestuzhev had extricated his country from the Swedish imbroglio; reconciled his imperial mistress with the courts of Vienna and London, her natural allies; enabled Russia to assert herself effectually in Poland, Turkey and Sweden, and isolated the restless king of Prussia by environing him with hostile alliances.
!-------------------!

immutable => inchangeable
The actions of men are subject to general immutable laws expressed in statistics.
The philosophers, he says, "are those who are able to grasp the eternal and immutable"; they are "those who set their affections on that which in each case really exists" (Rep. 480).
On returning to France, to the bosom of the great, strong, magnificent, peaceful, and glorious fatherland, I should have proclaimed her frontiers immutable; all future wars purely defensive, all aggrandizement antinational.

!-------------------!

impecunious => poor; having no money
In November 1340 Edward III., humiliated, impecunious and angry, returned suddenly to England from Flanders and vented his wrath upon the archbishop's brother, the chancellor, Robert de Stratford.
He consulted the older and graver Laurentius Andreae, who told him how "Doctor Martinus had clipped the wings of the pope, the cardinals and the big bishops," which could not fail to be pleasing intelligence to a monarch who was never an admirer of episcopacy, while the rich revenues of the church, accumulated in the course of centuries, were a tempting object to the impecunious ruler of an impoverished people.
The Irish exile enlisted first the services of Maurice Fitzgerald and Robert Fitzstephen, two half-brothers, both noted fighting men, and afterwards those of Richard de Clare, earl of Pembroke, an ambitious and impecunious magnate of broken fortunes.

impermeable => impossible to permeate
There are cases also where sedimentary rocks, formed below the sea or salt lagoons, are almost impermeable: thus the salt deposited in parts of the Upper Keuper of the New Red Sandstone, is protected by the red marls of the formation, and has never been washed out.
The surface of the earth is rarely impermeable, and the structure of the rocks largely determines the direction of flow of so much of the rainfall as sinks into the ground and is not evaporated.
Thus in the western mountain districts of Great Britain, largely composed of nearly impermeable rocks more Lion.
!-------------------!

impervious => incapable of being affected; impossible to penetrate

!-------------------!

implausible => unlikely; unbelievable

!-------------------!

incarnate => having bodily form
Thenceforward the Sikhs believe the spirit of Nanak to have been incarnate in each succeeding guru.
This is an attempt to explain how it came that Christ, though incarnate God, could be in error, e.g.
14 there is an allusion to the Word (= memra of the Targums), the Shekinah, and the Shekinah-glory, all of which the writer declares became incarnate in Jesus.
!-------------------!

inchoate => imperfectely formed or formulated
The liability to contribute is inchoate only when the sacrifice has been made.
We may, if we please, regard "good offices" as inchoate mediation, and "mediation" as good offices brought to the birth.
Thenceforth, till James came to the throne of England, the history of Scotland was but a series of inchoate revolutions, intrigues that led to nothing definite and skirmishes in the war of kirk and state.
!-------------------!

incongruity => state of not fitting
The attempt to solve the apparent incongruity of a perfect union of two complete and distinct natures in one person produced first Apollinarianism, which substituted the divine Logos for the human y ob's or 7rveuµa of Jesus, thereby detracting from the completeness of his humanity; and then Nestorianism, which destroyed the unity of Christ's person by affirming that the divine Logos dwelt in the man Jesus as in a temple, and that the union of the two was in respect of dignity, and furthermore that, inasmuch as the Logos could not have been born, to call Mary 9eororcos, " Godbearer," was absurd and blasphemous.
For instance, he employs rhyme in dealing with the most prosaic subjects, and thus produces the disagreeable effect of incongruity between style and matter.
It involves, moreover, the incongruity of supposing that thirty-seven years elapsed between Esau's marrying his Hittite wives (xxvi.
!-------------------!

inconsequential => insignificant; unimportant

!-------------------!

incorporate => introduce something into another thing already in existence
The Ritschl school, and others too, have made an earnest effort to incorporate Christ's words in Dogmatic and no longer shunt them into systems of " Christian Ethics."
1 The singers or Asaphites are at this time still distinguished from the Levites; the oldest attempt to incorporate them with that tribe appears in Exod.
C. Within each state powers of taxation, to a determinate or to an indeterminate extent, as the case may be, are by the constitution and laws of the state conferred, almost always for strictly defined purposes, (1) upon counties, (2) upon cities, boroughs and incorporate villages, and (3) in nearly all the states, though in widely varying degrees, upon the primary geographical divisions of counties, such as the town of New England and the township of the Middle and Western states.
!-------------------!

indeterminate => uncertain; indefinite
There is no recognition whatever of the principle of the indeterminate sentence.
But the bulk of the work consists of problems leading to indeterminate equations of the second degree, and these universally take the form that one or two (and never more) linear or quadratic functions of one variable x are to be made rational square numbers by finding a suitable value for x.
All that can be said at present about this difficult etymology is that in the non-Semitic Babylonian the medial m represented quite evidently an indeterminate nasal which could also be indicated by the combination rig.
!-------------------!

indigence => poverty
The hurricane, too, was followed by repeated droughts, and the inhabitants of the out-islands were reduced to indigence and want, a condition which is still, in some measure, in evidence.

The discovery of the insularity of Greenland might again give rise to the argument as to the distinction between island and continent.
He has, indeed, a true love of England, sometimes not without a suspicion of insularity, but always fresh and ingenuous.
Briefly, they are to be found in the conditions of the time; the increasing insularity of the English barons, now no longer the holders of estates in Normandy; the substitution of an unpopular for a popular king, an active spur to the rising forces of discontent; and the unprecedented demands for money - demands followed, not by honour, but by dishonour, to the arms of England abroad.

insuperable => insurmountable; unconquerable
This task was destined to prove one of almost insuperable difficulty.

A truce was concluded in 1317, but as the Sicilians helped the north Italian Ghibellines in the attack on Genoa, and Frederick seized some Church revenues for military purposes, the pope (John XXII.) excommunicated him and placed the island under an interdict (1321) which lasted until 1 335.
!-------------------!

internecine => deadly to both sides
The partition did not, however, prevent internecine wars.
There was more or less internecine conflict throughout the war, and local disaffection under Union rule; and Confederate recruiting was carried on even north of the Missouri.
And instigating these against the malcontents of his own people, brought enmities, which had been growing for a century, to a head, and initiated a devastating internecine warfare which was to continue for twenty years.
!-------------------!

interpolate => to insert; change by adding new words or material

!-------------------!

introspective => contemplating one's own thoughts and feelings
No man can exhaust by introspective analysis the hidden elements in his personality.
Subsequent psycho-physical investigations have all been in the spirit of his work; and although he consistently advocated the introspective method in psychological investigation, he was among the first to appreciate the help that may be given to it by animal and social and infant psychology.

All invidious class distinctions were done away with.
He conceived it as " a religious monopoly " to which " the nation at large contributes," while " Presbyterians alone receive," and which placed him in " a relation to the state " so " seriously objectionable " as to be " impossible to hold."5 The invidious distinction it drew between Presbyterians on the one hand, and Catholics, Friends, freethinking Christians, unbelievers and Jews on the other, who were compelled to support a ministry they " conscientiously disapproved," offended his always delicate conscience; while possibly the intellectual and ecclesiastical atmosphere of the city proved uncongenial to his liberal magnanimity.

The victory had a profound effect on the rest of the war.
He was profound in a way that surprises me.
He had a profound impact on Plato.
!-------------------!

prohibitive => so high as to prevent the purchase or use of, forbidding
In 1822 the prohibitive point was lowered to 70s.
Confiscations and settlements, prohibitive laws (such as those which ruined the woollen industry), penal enactments against the Roman Catholics, absenteeism, the creation for political purposes of 40s.
In order to do this, :mmems. he sometimes figured as a free-trader and sometimes as a protectionist, but always in a practical sense; if he imposed prohibitive tariffs, in 1664 and 1667, he also opened the free ports of Marseilles and Dunkirk, and engineered the Canal du midi.
!-------------------!

proliferate => to increase rapidly
The epithelial cells are then able to pass from their normal position, in consequence of which they proliferate and at the same time revert to a more primitive type of cell.
The change that is required to transform Exopterygota into Endopterygota is merely that a cell of hypodeimis should proliferate inwards instead of outwards, or that a minute hypodermal evaginated bud should be forced to the interior of the body by the pressure of a contracted cuticle.
!-------------------!

propensity => inclination, tendency
During hot days he had a propensity for walking around in just his boxers.
Men have a slight increased propensity towards baldness.
A propensity for violence is in no doubt.
!-------------------!

propitiate => to win over, appease
At first, it seems, Odainath attempted to propitiate the Parthian monarch Shaptir (Sapor) I.; but when his gifts were contemptuously rejected (Petr.
He hastened to propitiate the former by a donative of twice the usual amount, and excused his hasty acceptance of the throne to the senate by alleging the impatient zeal of the soldiers and the necessity of an imperator for the welfare of the state.
P. Nilsson, however, take the XbTpot to mean "water vessels," and connect the ceremony with the Hydrophoria, a libation festival to propitiate the dead who had perished in the flood of Deucalion.
!-------------------!

propriety => correct conduct, fitness
The propriety of this extended use is open to question and is denied by some logicians.
They broke the chain of authority, without, however, recognizing the propriety of toleration.
The Local Government Board must make inquiry into the propriety of allowing the lands to be taken, and the power to acquire the lands compulsorily can only be conferred by means of a provisional order confirmed by parliament.
!-------------------!

proscribe => to condemn, forbid, outlaw
Bellarmine did not proscribe the Copernican system, as has been maintained by Reusch (Der Process Galilei's and die Jesuiten, Bonn, 1879, p. 125); all he claimed was that it should be presented as an hypothesis until it should receive scientific demonstration.
Delegates from Allegheny, Westmoreland, Washington and Fayette counties met here on the 7th of September 1791, and passed resolutions severely denouncing the excise tax; and a similarly constituted gathering, on the 24th of August 1792, voted to proscribe all persons who assisted in the enforcement of laws taxing the manufacture of liquor.
A mass meeting of about 5000 citizens of the above-mentioned counties (many of them armed militiamen), at Braddock's Field, on the 1st and 2nd of August 1794, threatened to take possession of Fort Lafayette and to burn Pittsburg, but cooler counsel prevailed, and after voting to proscribe several persons, and marching in a body through the streets of the town, the crowd dispersed without doing any damage.
!-------------------!

puissant => powerful
The first MS. which he undertook in London was one sent to him by "the noble and puissant lord, Lord Antone, Erle of Ryvyers," consisting of a translation "into right good and fayr Englyssh" of Jean de Teonville's French version of a Latin work, "a glorious fair mirror to all good Christian people."
When they might have won national independence, after their warfare with the Swabian emperors, they let the golden opportunity slip. Pampered with commercial prosperity, eaten to the core with inter-urban rivalries, they submitted to despots, renounced the use of arms, and offered themselves in the hour of need, defenceless and disunited to the shock of puissant nations.
Setting aside, however, the strong improbability that a style of decoration so widely practised and so highly esteemed could have remained unknown during a century and a half to experts working for one of the most puissant chieftains in Japan, we have the evidence of trustworthy traditions and written records that enamelled faience was made by the potters at Tatsumonjithe principal factory of Satsuma-ware in early daysas far back as the year 1676.
!-------------------!

punctilious => careful in observing rules fo behavior
The kingdom of Jerusalem consisted of a society of peers, in which the king might be Primus, but in which he was none the less subject to a punctilious law, regulating his position equally with that of every member of the society.
"As far as the service goes he is quite punctilious, your excellency; but his character..." said Timokhin.
It reflects the greatest credit on the strict and almost punctilious conscientiousness of the governor, and on the assiduity and the high principle which animated the emperor.
!-------------------!

purport => to profess, suppose, claim
The use for which the pot was intended and the purport of the inscription have been much disputed, there being at least as many interpretations as there are words in the inscription.
The oldest books now in the possession of the modern Jains purport to go back, not to the foundation of the existing order in the 6th century B.C., but only to the time of Bhadrabahu, three centuries later.
The purport of these resolutions was to deny to Congress the power to prohibit slavery in the territories and to declare all previous enactments to this effect unconstitutional.
!-------------------!

pusillanimous => cowardly; showing a lack of courage or determination; timid
A strong sense of duty, genuine piety, and a cautious but by no means pusillanimous common-sense coloured every action of his patient, laborious and eventful life.
Might have experienced much difficulty in reducing it, had it not been for the pusillanimous conduct of David, the last emperor, who surrendered the place almost unconditionally.
A late and dubious tradition asserts that the family name became so discredited owing to the pusillanimous conduct of John and Edward Baliol that it was abandoned by its owners in favour of the form Baillie.
!-------------------!

quagmire => marsh, difficult situation
I stumbled into a quagmire of my own making.

!-------------------!

qualm => sudden feeling of faintness or nausea
Evil is not having to overcome any moral qualms about killing innocent people.
I don't feel any qualms about applying it to the people who wrote and voted for the rule.
And if you get any qualms about workplace inspections, there's a guide to that too.
!-------------------!

query => question
Surely the Indians would guess that their query would eventually assemble.
!-------------------!

quiescent => inactive, still
It has been quiescent since 1566, and is now completely extinct.
But experience in other parts of Japan shows that a long quiescent crater may at any moment burst into disastrous activity.
But the French were too weak in these seas for offensive movements, and therefore remained quiescent at Bourbon and Mauritius till the beginning of 1782.
!-------------------!

quorum => number of memeber necessary to conduct a meeting
But enough members remained to give the legal quorum, and it was carried by 120 to 2 votes.
Cannon, were adopted on the 14th of February 1890; they provided that every member must vote, unless pecuniarily interested in a measure, that members present and not voting may be counted for a quorum, and that no dilatory motion be entertained by the speaker.
When a quorum, with some difficulty, was obtained, another period of retrograde legislation set in.
!-------------------!

raconteur => witty, skillful storyteller
"The vicomte is a wonderful raconteur," said she to another.
He had the reputation of being an excellent raconteur, and Quintilian (x.
He had been introduced to Richelieu in 1623, and by his humour and his talent as a raconteur soon made himself indispensable to the cardinal.
!-------------------!

raiment => clothing
Yet men imagine gods to be born, and to have raiment and voice and body, like themselves..
God will give food and raiment to those who are seeking His kingdom.
According to E, Moses with Aaron is to demand from Pharaoh the release of Israel, which will be effected in spite of his opposition; in assurance thereof the promise is given that they shall serve God upon this mountain; moreover, the people on their departure are to borrow raiment and jewels from their Egyptian neighbours.
!-------------------!

ramification => implication, consequence
In February 1846, however, an insurrection broke out in Cracow, apparently a ramification of a widely spread conspiracy throughout Poland.
In its lowest parts this plain barely keeps above sea-level, but it rises gradually towards the interior, terminating in a ramification of valleys.
He clearly did not think of the inevitable ramification for his unwise action.
!-------------------!

rarefied => belonging to, or appealing to an exclusive group; esoteric
Hittorf examined the phenomena exhibited in so-called high vacua, that is, in exceedingly rarefied gases.
This phenomenon is connected with the fact that incandescent bodies, especially in rarefied gases, throw off or emit electrons or gaseous negative ions.
There he continued his researches on the discharge of electricity in rarefied gases, only just missing the discovery of the X-rays described by W.
!-------------------!

rationale => fundamental reason
Matters of warrants and probable cause escaped his wife's rationale, replaced by her conscience, which stood firmly in charge.
It is the mode, or rationale, of all progress from the lower to the highest unity or identification.
The same process was used for centuries after Pliny, but its rationale was not understood.
!-------------------!

rebus => puzzle in which pictures or symbols represent words
Clerc, De rebus Thyatirenorum (1893).
An English translation of the De rebus christianorum was published by Murdock in 1851.
It was he who first unearthed (in the convent of St Emmeran at Regensburg) the remarkable Latin poems of the nun Hrosvitha of Gandersheim, of which he published an edition (Nuremberg, 1501), the historical poem Ligurinus sive de rebus gestis Frederici primi imperatoris libri x.
!-------------------!

recalcitrant => resisting authority or control
Matter was a potentially recalcitrant element.
Grindal himself was, however, inclined to be recalcitrant from different motives.
In 1847 Lord Minto visited the tionary Italian courts to try to induce the recalcitrant despots agitation, to mend their ways, so as to avoid revolution and war, 1847.
!-------------------!

recant => retract a statement of opinion
Attempts were made by the officials to induce him to recant, but without effect.
He was compelled to recant, under strong pressure from Pope Innocent III.
Barnes was forced to apologize and recant; and Gardiner delivered a series of sermons at St Paul's Cross to counteract Barnes' invective.
!-------------------!

recondite => abstruse, profound
The idea of tracing the sun's path among the stars was, when it occurred to Chaldaean astronomers, an original and, relatively to their means, a recondite one.
A more recondite work is his Compendium of Spherical Astronomy (1906).
(t) The words of several verses in the Hebrew Scriptures which are regarded as containing a recondite sense are placed over each other, and the letters are formed into new words by reading them vertically.
!-------------------!

redoubtable => formidable, arousing fear
The Franks were redoubtable warriors, and were generally of great stature.
" Ex ungue leonem " might have been justly said, for he attacked, and attacked successfully, the redoubtable Warburton.
The point at issue was, that neither in the polyphonic school, in which Zarlino was educated, nor in the later monodic school, of which his recalcitrant pupil, Vincenzo Galilei, was the most redoubtable champion, could those proportions be tolerated in practice, however attractive they might be to the theorist in their mathematical aspect.
!-------------------!

refractory => stubborn, resisting ordinary methods of treatment
Pascal solved the hitherto refractory problem of the general quadrature of the cycloid, and proposed and solved a variety of others relating to the centre of gravity of the curve and its segments, and to the volume and centre of gravity of solids of revolution generated in various ways by means of it.
An abbot also had the power of excommunicating refractory nuns, which he might use if desired by their abbess.
Fire-clays include all those varieties of clay which are very refractory to heat.
!-------------------!

refulgent => brightly shining, resplendent
Pascal solved the hitherto refractory problem of the general quadrature of the cycloid, and proposed and solved a variety of others relating to the centre of gravity of the curve and its segments, and to the volume and centre of gravity of solids of revolution generated in various ways by means of it.
An abbot also had the power of excommunicating refractory nuns, which he might use if desired by their abbess.
Fire-clays include all those varieties of clay which are very refractory to heat.
!-------------------!

refute => to contradict, disprove
The course of human history is regarded by those writers who are most concerned to refute Judaism as a progressive divine education.
His intellect was logical in the highest degree; he was clear and precise, an enemy of loose reasoning, and quick to refute prevailing fallacies.
To see the absurdity of the second paradox of relativity is easier than to refute it.
!-------------------!

regale => to entertain
The pope ignored the decisions of the assembly; so, dropping the regale, the king demanded that, to obviate further conflict, the assembly should define the limits of the authority due respectively to the king, the Church and the pope.
He clung to his right of regale, or enjoyment of the revenues of bishoprics during their vacancy, though it was at times commuted for a fixed payment.
Among them the Vinland sagas, also a Norwegian work of the 13th century, called Speculum regale (The King's Mirror), and some papal letters, give interesting glimpses of the life of this colony.
!-------------------!

relegate => to consign to an inferior position
Lipsius and Dobschiitz relegate the book to the 4th century.
With such remains before us it is no longer sufficient to relegate Minos to the regions of sun-myths.
His open advocacy of Jansenist opinions, however, caused his superiors to relegate him to the most obscure houses of the order, and finally to keep him under surveillance at the abbey of St Germain-des-Pres at Paris.
!-------------------!

remonstrate => to object or protest
Just before the books came, Mr. Gilman had begun to remonstrate with Miss Sullivan on the ground that I was working too hard, and in spite of my earnest protestations, he reduced the number of my recitations.

He was, however, opposed by Sophronius, a monk from Palestine, who, after vainly appealing to Cyrus, actually went to Constantinople to remonstrate with Sergius himself.
!-------------------!

renege => to go back on one's word
Just before the books came, Mr. Gilman had begun to remonstrate with Miss Sullivan on the ground that I was working too hard, and in spite of my earnest protestations, he reduced the number of my recitations.
He treated it with increasing contempt, and the most that it could do was to remonstrate to the States-General.
He was, however, opposed by Sophronius, a monk from Palestine, who, after vainly appealing to Cyrus, actually went to Constantinople to remonstrate with Sergius himself.
!-------------------!

repine => fret, complain
How do you think it feels to live with the regret that stems from having done something beyond reparation to someone as beautiful as she is in this life?
Sir John Bowring, who represented Great Britain in China, failing to secure the reparation and apology which he demanded, directed the British admiral to bombard Canton.
He projected a railway to the Sudan, and also the reparation of the barrage.
!-------------------!

reprise => repetition, especially of a piece of music
How do you think it feels to live with the regret that stems from having done something beyond reparation to someone as beautiful as she is in this life?

He projected a railway to the Sudan, and also the reparation of the barrage.
!-------------------!

rescind => to cancel
As a preliminary to negotiation, the government was required to rescind all the obnoxious measures.
For more than a year all efforts - headed by the poet Whittier - to rescind that censure were without avail, but early in 1874 it was annulled.
Further, the establishment of a protectorate does not necessarily rescind treaties made between the protected state and other states, at all events when it is not in reality conquest or cession, or when any modification would be to the injury of third parties (Pail.
!-------------------!

reticent => nor speaking freely, reserved, reluctant
Even the reticent members participated enthusiastically.

He was, however, blameless in morals and reverent in religion.
He walked down the hill, pausing a reverent moment at the headstone, and then ducked under a limb as he continued down the hill.
!-------------------!

riposte => a quick clever reply to an insult or criticism
Or still more the dialectical device by which the sceptic claims to escape the riposte that his very argument presumes the validity of this or that principle, viz.
!-------------------!

rubric => protocol, title or heading
According to the rubric of the Roman Missal (tit.
It becomes, then, a question whether the present-day practice of many of the clergy, ostensibly based on the rubric of 1549, is in fact covered by this.
The rubric of 1532 had this curious wording: "And after the Second Lesson shall be used and said, Benedictus in English, as followeth."
!-------------------!

salacious => lascivious, lustful
No sentences.. :( 
!-------------------!

I know a salubrious place which is pedestrian-only.
!-------------------!

sardonic => cynical, scornfully mocking
His smile was sardonic, yet his eyes held a glint of humor.
The rest of the Jews rated the Sadducees as atheists, just as the rest of the Greeks rated the Epicureans as atheists and discerned, as Plutarch said, the sardonic grin behind the mask of their obsequious devotion to the ceremonies at which the force of public opinion compelled their attendance.
His mouth twisted into a sardonic smile.
!-------------------!

sartorial => pertaining to tailors
This one wasn't just pretty; she was downright gorgeous and carried herself with a sartorial elegance.
!-------------------!

satiate => to satisfy
This one wasn't just pretty; she was downright gorgeous and carried herself with a sartorial elegance.
!-------------------!

saturate => imbue througout, soak thoroughly
The most satisfactory growth is maintained when the amount of water present is not more than 40 to 60% of what would saturate it.
It is found, however, that the same element has not always the same atomic refraction, the difference being due to the nature of the elements which saturate its valencies.
To him belongs the merit of carrying out some of the earliest determinations of the quantities by weight in which acids saturate bases and bases acids, and of arriving at the conception that those amounts of different bases which can saturate the same quantity of a particular acid are equivalent to each other.
!-------------------!

saturnine => gloomy
We still contemplate and .consider; we still speak of men as jovial, saturnine or mercurial; we still talk of the ascendancy of genius, or a disastrous defeat.
The influence of a particular planet has also lef t traces in various languages; but the French and English jovial and the English saturnine correspond rather to the gods who served as types in chiromancy than to the planets which bear the same names.
!-------------------!

satyr => a creature that is half-man, half beast, with the horns and legs of a goat
In one of these monuments was the famous Satyr of Praxiteles.
Amymone having thrown her spear at a stag, missed it, but hit a satyr asleep in the brake.

!-------------------!

schematic => relating to or in the form of an outline or diagram
A, Schematic longitudinal section through a zooid and bud of Stylophora digitata.
It is, as it were, a schedule to be filled in, and is connected with the disjunctive judgment as a schematic setting forth of alternatives, not with the hypothetical, and ultimately the apodictic judgment with their suggestion that it is the real movement of thought that is subjected to analysis.
The Cephalopoda can be derived without much difficulty from the schematic Mollusc, if we assume that some metameric repetition of organs has occurred, as explained above in reference to the coelom.
!-------------------!

secrete => produce and release substance into organism
A few secrete colouring matters other than chlorophyll.
Then come the glandular surface (C), which is formed of smooth polished epidermis with numerous glands that secrete the fluid contents of the pitcher, and finally the detentive surface (D), of which the cells are produced into long and strong bristles which point A FIG.
Boutaric, Correspondance secrete de Louis X V.; Madame de Pompadour's Correspondance published by P. Malassi; Dietric, Les Mattresses de Louis X V.; and Fleury, Louis XV.
!-------------------!

sedition => behaviour prompting rebellion
It is a defence against sedition and socialism.
Many of the state Acts on sedition bear date of 1919, i.e.
In Constantinople itself sedition and profligacy were rampant, the emperors were the tools of faction and cared but little for the interests of their subjects, whose lot was one of hopeless misery and depravity.
!-------------------!

sedulous => diligent, assiduous
The success of this very useful scheme was due chiefly to his sedulous interest and help.
The hope of eventual emancipation was stimulated by sedulous propagandists from each of these countries; from time to time armed bands of insurgents were manned and equipped in the small neighbouring states, with or without the co-operation of the governments.
Here we find less evidence of sedulous workmanship, yet not infrequently a piercing sweetness, a depth of emotion, a sincere and spontaneous lovableness, which are irresistibly touching and inspiring.
!-------------------!

seismic => relating to earthquakes
Great damage was done by a seismic wave following the shock.
The earthquake occurred early in the morning of December 28, and so far as Messina was concerned the damage was done chiefly by the shock and by the fires which broke out afterwards; the seismic wave which followed was comparatively innocuous.
The area of this seismic disturbance extended over north-eastern India, from Manipur to Sikkim; but the focus was in the Khasi and Garo hills.
!-------------------!

sensual => relating to the senses, gratifying the physical (sexual) senses
Her fingers caressed his bare forearms, the sensual touch increasing her pulse.
His will-power had early been undermined by the opium habit, and was further weakened by the sensual excesses that ultimately killed him.
The aim is not self-destruction, but self-preservation; and yet the ethics of Manichaeism appears in point of fact as thoroughly ascetic. The Manichaean had, above all, to refrain from sensual enjoyment, shutting himself up against it by three seals - the signaculum oris, manus and sinus.
!-------------------!

sensuous => relating to the senses
In the second or classical form of art the idea of humanity finds an adequate sensuous representation.
Their petting grew more frenzied, more instinctive, and far from the languid, sensuous control he had intended to use with her.
They teach the inferior but working part of our intellect, the " Understanding," that its picture of sensuous reality envisaged in time and space must be as fully articulated as is possible - as much differentiated into detail, and as perfectly integrated again into unity and system.
!-------------------!

sentient => aware, concious, able to perceive
All living and sentient things are formed out of insentient atoms.
Its warm touch seemed so like a human caress, I really thought it was a sentient being, capable of loving and protecting me.
Finally, in the spirit of Plato's Phaedo and the dialogue Eudemus, the Protrepticus holds that the soul is bound to the sentient members of the body as prisoners in Etruria are bound face to face with corpses; whereas the later view of the De Anima is that the soul is the vital principle of the body and the body the necessary organ of the soul.
!-------------------!

sextant => navigation tool that determines latitude and longitude
He also invented a reflecting sextant for observing the distance between the moon and the fixed stars, - the same in every essential as the instrument which is still in everyday use at sea under the name of Hadley's quadrant.
No further practical advance appears to have been made in the design or construction of the instrument till the year 1723, when John Hadley (best known as the inventor of the sextant) presented to the Royal Society a reflecting telescope of the Newtonian construction, with a metallic speculum of 6-in.
!-------------------!

shard => a piece of broken glass or pottery
The lord or owner of Shard; s he was worshipped under the form of a black rectangular stone, a sort of Petraean Kaaba (Suidas Lex.
Which has been removed to the level of their bases; these were either idols of Dhu-shard and Allat, or more probably were designed to mark the limits of the Karam of the sanctuary.
!-------------------!

sidereal => relating to the stars
For example, if the right ascension of a star is exactly 15°, it will pass the meridian one sidereal hour after the vernal equinox.
In this remarkable work Kant, proceeding from the Newtonian conception of the solar system, extends his consideration to the entire sidereal system, points out how the whole may be mechanically regarded, and throws out the important speculation which has since received the title of the nebular hypothesis.
We perceive then that the fundamental problems of sidereal science are closely linked up with the elementary and indispensable procedures of celestial measurement.
!-------------------!

simian => apelike, relating to apes
This expectation has hardly been fulfilled, but of late years the notion of a variety of the human race, geologically ancient, differing from any known in historic times, and with characters approaching the simian, has been supported by further discoveries.
On the other hand it does not follow necessarily from a theory of evolution of species that mankind must have descended from a single stock, for the hypothesis of development admits of the argument, that several simian species may have culminated in several races of man.
It has to be borne in mind that Linnaeus, plainly as he recognized the likeness of the higher simian and the human types, does not seem to have entertained the thought of accounting for this similarity by common descent.
!-------------------!

simile => comparison of one thing with another using "like" or "as"
Many times a simile may contain the word "as" or "like".
Neither art nor nature could supply a better simile of the grace of God than this.
The simile in the next line serves to emphasize the speed of the fall.
!-------------------!

sinecure => well-paying job that requieres little or no work
He took orders on his presentation to the vicarage of Bridstow in the following year, and a small sinecure living in Wales was besides procured for him by his friend Samuel Molyneux (1689-1728).
The living was practically a sinecure, and he devoted himself to political pamphleteering and newspaper correspondence, the result of extensive European travel, a wide acquaintance with the leading personages of the day, strong views on ecclesiastical subjects from a high-church standpoint, and particularly on the politics of the Eastern Question and Mahommedanism.
He was transferred to the sinecure office of the Duchy of Lancaster, but held it only till Nov., when, on the appointment of a small war committee of the Cabinet from which he was excluded, he resigned, being unwilling to accept a position of general responsibility for war policy if he had no effective control.
!-------------------!

skeptic => one who doubts
I need to see more hard evidence to become less of a skeptic.
Since he was a skeptic, he doubted that anyone would be able to accomplish the seemingly impossible task.
He couldn't understand why the woman was still a skeptic even after being shown research and facts on the topic.
!-------------------!

sobriety => seriousness
He was well adapted to his time by his good sense and sobriety of judgment.
As an advocate he occasionally forgets that sobriety of judgment and expression become an historian.
The buildings of the latest French style keep a certain purity and sobriety in Normandy which they do not keep elsewhere.
!-------------------!

solicitous => concerned, attentive, eager
He is even solicitous to show that his point of view is that of the cultivated gentleman and not of the specialist of any order.
Neper being solicitous to know farther of him concerning this matter, he could give no other account of it than that it was by proportional numbers.
He was an able man, with a special talent for finance, free from all taint of personal corruption, and sincerely solicitous for the honour of Athens, but enslaved to popularity, and without principles of policy.
!-------------------!

soliloquy => literary or dramatic speech by one character, not adressed to others
Was there a soliloquy in the play?
The soliloquy at the end showed a man still puzzled by his continuing inability to ever see anything more than the facts.
Look back to the end of his final soliloquy.
!-------------------!

somatic => relating to or affecting the body, corporeal
Abd, the solid opistho- - - operc somatic carapace.
Then we have Beard's " germ-cell " hypothesis, in which he holds that many of the germ-cells in the growing embryo fail to reach their proper position - the generative areas - and settle down and become quiescent in some somatic tissue of the embryo.
Some workers regard certain appearances in dividing cells found in cancer as evidence of a reversion of the somatic cell to the germcell type (heterotypical), otherwise found only in the process which results in the formation of an embryo.
!-------------------!

soporific => sleep producing
Moliere's medical student accounts for it by a soporific principle contained in the opium.
According to Sir Thomas Fraser nothing else can compete with alcohol as a food in desperate febrile cases, and to this use must be added its antipyretic power already explained and its action as a soporific. During its administration in febrile cases the drug must be most carefully watched, as its action may prove deleterious to the nervous system and the circulation in certain classes of patient.
In such cases the soporific action is not that which is sought, and so opium is preferable.
!-------------------!

sordid => filthy, contemptible and corrupt
For the first time in their history, they stood a real chance of turning a sordid love story into a pure one.
Obviously they thought there was something sordid to hide.
His vices were rather of the sordid than of the satanic order.
!-------------------!

spectrum => band of color, broad range of related ideas or objects
Our eyes are capable of seeing only a narrow spectrum of light.
Let us suppose that the light is incident perpendicularly, and that the grating interval increases from the centre towards that edge which lies nearest to the spectrum under observation, and decreases towards the hinder edge.
Mag., 1837, 10, p. 364) was that any ray which suffered in traversing the plate a retardation of an odd number of half wave-lengths would be extinguished, and that thus the spectrum would be seen interrupted by a number of dark bars.
!-------------------!

spendthrift => person who spends money recklessly
During his absence she married the profligate spendthrift, P. Cornelius Dolabella.
That might be true, but there was no point in working at becoming a spendthrift simply because he had money.
Was a spendthrift and a bigot.
!-------------------!

sporadic => irregular
His nobles, whom he tried to cow by sporadic acts of violence, rebelled against him.
But the failures were sporadic only.
On the other hand, German sporadic attacks by sea and air on British watering places and the increasing activity of German submarines gave Mr. Churchill and the Admiralty much concern.
!-------------------!

squalor => filthy, wretched condition
He was delighted with the varied play of the waterfalls, but no glamour blinded him to the squalor of Swiss peasant life.
Beckwith visited the valleys, and was painfully struck by the squalor and ignorance of a people who had so glorious a past.
!-------------------!

staccato => marked by abrupt, clear-cut sounds
While still in the anteroom Prince Andrew heard loud voices and a ringing staccato laugh--a laugh such as one hears on the stage.
!-------------------!

stanch => to stop or check the flow of
In 1759, during the Seven Years' War, the French, as Maria Theresa's allies, occupied the town, and, much to the irritation of Goethe's father, who was a stanch partisan of Frederick the Great, a French lieutenant, Count Thoranc, was quartered on the Goethe household.
Lloyd was a stanch supporter of the revolution.
The queen required a protector, whom she found, not in the feeble Darnley, nor in any of the leaders of the factions, but in the strong, determined earl who had ever been a stanch supporter of the throne against the Protestant party and English influence.
!-------------------!

stentorian => extremely loud
But before he had finished reading, a stentorian major-domo announced that dinner was ready!
!-------------------!

stint => to be sparing
To attain this end he lavished his gold - or rather the gold provided by the clergy in his obedience - without stint, and conceived a succession of the most adventurous projects, of which one at least was to leave a lasting mark on history.
Minutilla, the American stint, is darker, with olive feet, and ranges from the Arctic New World to Brazil.
Fred O'Connor, back from his second stint at the library and historical museum, was now poring over the newspaper and circling the Saturday garage sales in the classified ads.
!-------------------!

stipulate => to specify as an essential condition
To avoid privacy issues at this point, let's stipulate that everything is recorded only for your future reference.
His previous experience made him stipulate for full powers and a sufficient revenue.
The first step was to decree the penalty of six years' imprisonment against any person who should sell specie for a more considerable quantity of assignats, or who should stipulate a different price for commodities according as the payment was to be made in specie or in assignats.
!-------------------!

stolid => having or showing little emotion
His facial features suggested a stolid character.
Zwingli, who details these articles, as he says, that the world may see that they are "fanatical, stolid, audacious, impious," can scarcely be acquitted of unfairness in joining together two of them, - the fourth and fifth, - thus making the article treat "of the avoiding of abominable pastors in the church" (Super devitatione abominabilium pastorum in Ecclesia), though there is nothing about pastors in the fourth article, and nothing about abominations in the fifth, and though in a marginal note he himself explains that the first two copies that were sent him read as he does, but the other copies make two articles, as in fact they evidently are.
The new tsar, Alexander III., was an apt pupil of his tutor Pobedonostsev (q.v.), the celebrated procurator of the Holy Synod, for whom the representative system was a modern lie," and his reign covered a period of frank reaction, during which there was not only no question of affected even the stolid and apparently immovable masses of the peasantry.
!-------------------!

stratified => arranged in layers
Well-worn pebbles of amorphous quartz (agate, chalcedony, jasper, &c.) are found in the stratified drift along the western side of the Tertiary region of the state, and from Columbus northward.
Ignoring temperature effect, and taking the density as a function of the pressure, surfaces of equal pressure are also of equal density, and the fluid is stratified by surfaces orthogonal to the lines of force; n ap, dy, P d z, or X, Y, Z (4) are the partial differential coefficients of some function P, =fdplp, of x, y, z; so that X, Y, Z must be the partial differential coefficients of a potential -V, such that the force in any direction is the downward gradient of V; and then dP dV (5) ax + Tr=0, or P+V =constant, in which P may be called the hydrostatic head and V the head of potential.
The rocks here concerned are the extension of the same stratified Palaeozoic formations already described as occurring~in the Appalachian region and around the Great Lakes.
!-------------------!

striated => marked with thin, narrow grooves or channels
Characters, those of one set being dull and striated, whilst those of the other set are bright and smooth.

stricture => something that restrains, negative criticism
For this reason it is used to remove corneal opacities, deafness due to thickening of the membrane, stricture of the oesophagus and hypertrophy of the pylorus, it has also been successful in the treatment of adhesive parametritis.
Should the patient survive the first twenty-four hours death generally results later from stricture of the oesophagus or intestine, from destruction of the glands of the stomach or from exhaustion.
Even where they undergo healing they may cause such a stricture of the calibre of the intestinal canal as to give rise to the symptoms of obstruction which ultimately prove fatal.

!-------------------!

stultify => to impair or reduce to uselessness
Mr Chamberlain had relied on his personal influence, which from 1895 to 1902 had been supreme; but his own resignation, and the course of events, had since 1903 made his personality less authoritative, and new interests - such as the opposition to the Education Act, to the heavy taxation, and to Chinese labour in the Transvaal, and indignation over the revelations concerned with the war - were monopolizing attention, to the weakening of his hold on the public. The revival in trade, and the production of new statistics which appeared to stultify Mr Chamberlain's prophecies of progressive decline, enabled the free-trade champions to reassure their audiences as to the very foundation of his case, and to represent the whole tariff reform movement as no less unnecessary than risky.
!-------------------!

stupefy => to dull the senses of, stun, astonish
Mr Chamberlain had relied on his personal influence, which from 1895 to 1902 had been supreme; but his own resignation, and the course of events, had since 1903 made his personality less authoritative, and new interests - such as the opposition to the Education Act, to the heavy taxation, and to Chinese labour in the Transvaal, and indignation over the revelations concerned with the war - were monopolizing attention, to the weakening of his hold on the public.

!-------------------!

stygian => dark and gloomy, hellish
Mr Chamberlain had relied on his personal influence, which from 1895 to 1902 had been supreme; but his own resignation, and the course of events, had since 1903 made his personality less authoritative, and new interests - such as the opposition to the Education Act, to the heavy taxation, and to Chinese labour in the Transvaal, and indignation over the revelations concerned with the war - were monopolizing attention, to the weakening of his hold on the public.

!-------------------!

subpoena => notice ordering someone to appear in court
Mr Chamberlain had relied on his personal influence, which from 1895 to 1902 had been supreme; but his own resignation, and the course of events, had since 1903 made his personality less authoritative, and new interests - such as the opposition to the Education Act, to the heavy taxation, and to Chinese labour in the Transvaal, and indignation over the revelations concerned with the war - were monopolizing attention, to the weakening of his hold on the public.

At the point where the river Santa breaks through the Cordillera Negra that range begins to subside, while the Maritime Cordillera continues as one chain to and beyond the frontier of Ecuador.
When her sobs began to subside, he spoke in as calm a voice as he could muster.
!-------------------!

substantiate => to support with proof or evidence
Now, in the excited state of popular feeling at that period, the failure of government to substantiate an accusation of treason would have been a serious matter.
For some time after the occupation of Rome the pope, in order to substantiate the pretence that his spiritual freedom had been diminished, avoided the creation of cardinals and the nomination of bishops.
The general charges, which they endeavoured to substantiate by forged letters, need not count for much, and in many cases they only exaggerated what, if true, was not so heinous as they suggested.
!-------------------!

substantive => essential
In other cases the pronunciation can be ascertained only from the context, as in use, unvoiced for the substantive, voiced for the verb.
There is a basis of reality in the Toltec traditions is shown by the word toltecatl having become among the later Aztecs a substantive signifying an artist or skilled craftsman.
Though, for simplicity and universality of thought, even in science, we must use the abstraction of attributes, and, by the necessity and weakness of language, must signify what are not substances by nouns substantive, we must guard against the over-abstraction of believing that a thing exists as we abstract it.
!-------------------!

subsume => to include, incorporate
In fixing the genus of a thing, we subsume it under a higher universal, of which 1 Strictly Aristotle's classification is into four as S&acbopa really belongs to ybvor.
!-------------------!

subversive => intended to undermine or underthrow, especially an established government
He became a journalist, and at an early stage of his career had the first of his many experiences of imprisonment for the subversive tendency of his writings.
The war policy of the Government was declared to be primarily the protection of Islam, particularly Turkish Islam, against the hostile and dangerously subversive policy of Great Britain.
The large majority chose the latter; and thus 1,800 officers were retired on small pensions, and became a dangerous leaven for all subversive activities against the Government.
!-------------------!

succor => relief, help in time of distress or want
He became a journalist, and at an early stage of his career had the first of his many experiences of imprisonment for the subversive tendency of his writings.

!-------------------!

suffrage => the right to vote
The right of suffrage is confined by the constitution to adult male citizens who have resided in the state for one year.

The deputies are elected by direct suffrage for the legislative session of three years, and have the same immunities from legal process as the senators.
!-------------------!

!-------------------!

supplant => to replace, substitute
His dynasty was destined to supplant that of the Merovingian house.
He could trade upon Edwards precocious hatred of Marys religion, he could rely upon French fears of her Spanish inclinations, and the success which bad attended his schemes in England deluded him into a belief that he could supplant the Tudor with a Dudley dynasty.
He defends them against Zeus, who, in accordance with a widely diffused mythical theory, desires to destroy the human race and supplant them by a new and better species, or who simply revenges a trick in which men get the better of him.
!-------------------!

suppliant => beseeching, a person making a humble plea to someone in power or authority
Those of the first class were pedestals, so small and low that the suppliant could kneel upon them; these stood inside the temples, in front of the sacred image.
They guaranteed absolute security to the suppliant within their limits.
Tins laudable intention was wrecked by the treachery of the young heir to the French throne; on the bridge of Montereau Charles deliberately murdered the suppliant duke, as he knelt to do homage, thinking thereby that he would make an end of the Burgundian party (Sept.

!-------------------!

syllogism => a form of deductive reasoning with a major premise, a minor premise, and a conclusion
When Aristotle called syllogism X6yos, he meant that it is a combination of premises involving a conclusion of necessity.
The Posterior Analytics, on demonstrative syllogism, or science; 5.
Secondly, he made no division of logic. In the Categories he distinguished names and propositions for the sake of the classification of names; in the De Interpretatione he distinguished nouns and verbs from sentences with a view to the enunciative sentence: in the Analytics he analysed the syllogism into premisses and premisses into terms and copula, for the purpose of syllogism.
!-------------------!

sylvan => related to the woods or forest
The forest contains valuable sylvan products, and there are great possibilities for the cultivation of rubber.
The Tiergarten, the beautiful west-end park with its thickets of dense undergrowth and winding lanes and lakes has lost somewhat of its sylvan character owing to building encroachments on the north side and the laying out of new rides and drives.
The two branches of the Tyne join at Warden, a little above the town of Hexham, with its great abbey, and the united stream continues past Corbridge, where a Roman road crossed it, in a beautiful sylvan valley.
!-------------------!

He wore a glowing talisman on a leather chain around his neck.
I don't use history to predict the future, like some talisman that lets me pick winning lottery numbers (don't I wish).
The image or idol differs from the fetish, charm, talisman, phylactery or miraculous relic, only in this, that either in the flat or the round it resembles the power adored; it has a prototype capable of being brought before the eye and visualized.
!-------------------!

tangential => peripheral, irrelevant, digressing
Lord Rayleigh has shown that there is a tangential motion as well as a motion in and out.
Luminous arcs (T), tangential to the upper and lower parts of each halo, also occur, and in the case of the inner halo, the arcs may be prolonged to form a quasi-elliptic halo.1 The physical explanation of halos originated with Rene Descartes, who ascribed their formation to the presence of icecrystals in the atmosphere.
This is called the tangential area, and will be denoted by T1.
!-------------------!

tautology => unnecessary repetition
The "De" henceforth became part of the name, having quite lost its earliest significance, and with unconscious tautology the barony is commonly referred to as that of De Clifford.
It is now generally recognized that it is mere tautology to speak of zoology and comparative anatomy, and that museum naturalists must give attention as well to the inside as to the outside of animals.
!-------------------!

taxonomy => science of classification
References to works dealing with the taxonomy and geographical distribution of scorpions are given at the end of this article (28).
However, owing to the evolution of the vertebral column in various directions, and to the inconstant state of things in certain annectent groups, it is not possible, it seems, to apply the vertebral characters to taxonomy with that rigidity which E.
!-------------------!

tenet => belief, doctrine
He avers that this " metaphysic of experience " is not idealism, or the tenet that consciousness is the only reality.
At various periods in the history of the middle ages we encounter sudden outbreaks of millennarianism, sometimes as the tenet of a small sect, sometimes as a far-reaching movement.
Separation from European politics - the doctrine of" America for Americans "that was embodied later in the Monroe declaration - was a tenet cherished by Jefferson as by other leaders (not, however, Hamilton) and by none cherished more firmly, for by nature he was peculiarly opposed to war, and peace was a fundamental part of his politics.
!-------------------!

tenuous => weak, insubstantial
I had little doubt Quinn would tell Howie, disrupting his tenuous relationship with Julie.
Sarah broke the silence with a tenuous giggle that evoked a twisted smile from Jackson.
I knew I would be suborning a lie and allowing a relationship I felt strongly was tenuous at best to move forward into a life commitment.
!-------------------!

terrestrial => earthly, commonplace
Nature possesses three great educational or developmental schools - terrestrial, aquatic and aerial life.
The ball represented the terrestrial globe and the stick in his other hand a scepter.
Only one terrestrial planet is known to have an active hydrosphere, Earth.
!-------------------!

theocracy => government by priests representing a god
- The theocracy, however, was not destined to be established.
He worked with might and main for the continuation of the old theocracy, but before he died it had given way before an increasing Liberalism - even Yale was infected with the Episcopalianism that he hated.
When Godfrey died in July 1100 (after successful forays against the Mahommedans which took him as far as Damascus), it might seem as if a theocracy were after all to be established in Jerusalem, in spite of the events of 1099.
!-------------------!

thespian => an actor or actress

!-------------------!

timbre => voice tone color
Hence we must put down the quality or timbre as depending on the form.
The Scottish timbre is rarely wanting, even in places where scholastic or classical custom might have claimed, as in other literatures, an exclusive privilege.
The substance which determines the form of a column of air is demonstrabl y indifferent for the timbre or quality of tone so long as the sides of the tubes are equally elastic and rigid.
!-------------------!

toady => flatterer, yes-man
The idea brought up a tirade.
This is probably the sense in which we may interpret his tirade against Lord Whitworth at the diplomatic circle on the 13th of March.
In 1848, on his return to Paris, he published a violent tirade against Russia, which caused his expulsion from France.
!-------------------!

torpor => lethargy, dormancy, sluggishness
3 From this torpor they were roused by tidings which might well be interpreted as the restoration of divine favour.
The symptoms of acute poisoning are pain and diarrhoea, owing to the setting up of an active gastro-enteritis, the foeces being black (due to the formation of a sulphide of lead), thirst, cramps in the legs and muscular twitchings, with torpor, collapse, convulsions and coma.
The revival of the Czechs after a hundred years of torpor, due to the loss of their independence in 1620 and subsequent oppression at the hands of the Habsburgs and the dominant Germans, gave birth, from 1780 onwards, to a literary activity which still continues to yield rich fruit.
!-------------------!

torque => a turning or twisting force
When the force acts on a body free to turn about a fixed axis only, it is convenient to express the work done by the transformed product TO, where T is the average turning moment or torque acting to produce the displacement 0 radians.
The general theory of this kind of brake is as follows: - Let F be the whole frictional resistance, r the common radius of the rubbing surfaces, W the force which holds the brake from turning and whose line of action is at a perpendicular distance R from the axis of the shaft, N the revolutions of the shaft per minute, co its angular velocity in radians per second; then, assuming that the adjustments are made so that the engine runs steadily at a uniform speed, and that the brake is held still, clear of the stops and without oscillation, by W, the torque T exerted by the engine is equal to the frictional torque Fr acting at the brake surfaces, and this is measured by the statical moment of the weight W about the axis of revolution; that is T =Fr=WR...
(I) Hence WR measures the torque T.
!-------------------!

tortuous => having many twists and turns, highly complex
These rivers collect the drainage of the northern slopes of the Himalayas, and convey it, by long and tortuous although opposite routes, into India.
A striking contrast exists between the Moorish quarter, with its tortuous lanes and Oriental architecture, and the modern quarter, with its rectangular streets and wide open squares, frequently bordered with trees and adorned with fountains.
From its source, flows past the town of Sora, and has a very tortuous course from thence to the sea at Minturnae; its lower valley is for the most part of considerable width, and forms a fertile tract of considerable extent, bordered on both sides by hills covered with vines, olives and fruit trees, and thickly studded with towns and villages.
!-------------------!

transient => temporary, fleeting
There is a transient population of thousands of visitors during the year.
These exploits, however, were transient in their effects.
It is unusually hard, owing to the recent severe but transient cold, and all watered or waved like a palace floor.
!-------------------!

translucent => partially transparent
Glasses are generally transparent but may be translucent or opaque.
In the interior on the north, the Cappella del Corporale possesses a large silver shrine, resembling in form the cathedral façade, enriched with countless figures in relief and subjects in translucent coloured enamels - one of the most important specimens of early silversmith's work that yet exists in Italy.
The man with translucent skin and purple eyes – the one Jonny hadn't exactly greeted with open arms – stood a few feet away.
!-------------------!

travail => work, especially arduous work
For the first time all that pure, spiritual, inward travail through which she had lived appeared on the surface.
The most important of Considerant's other writings were Exposition du systeme de Fourier (1845), Principes du socialisme (1847), Theorie du droit de propriete et du droit au travail (1848).
Zola also wrote a series of three romances on cities, Lourdes, Rome, Paris (1894-98), novels on the "gospels" of population (Fecondite) and work (Travail), a volume of plays, and several volumes of criticism, .and other things.

tremulous => trembling, frugal, timid
She spoke in a soft, tremulous voice, and in the weary eyes that looked over her spectacles Sonya read all that the countess meant to convey with these words.
The sound of voices, the tramping feet, the horses' hoofs moving in mud, the crackling of wood fires near and afar, merged into one tremulous rumble.
When the crowd collected round him he seemed confused, but at the demand of the tall lad who had pushed his way up to him, he began in a rather tremulous voice to read the sheet from the beginning.
!-------------------!

trepidation => fear and anxiety
Yet even back then, behind the smiles, was great trepidation.
Reading through the various messages I begin to feel a little trepidation at the possibility of getting a job in the US.
The trepidation expressed by many western policy-makers is understandable.
!-------------------!

truculence => aggressiveness, ferocity
Rome had been roused to unwonted fury, and the truculence of the rebels was matched by the cruelty of their masters.
The mixed population, as a whole, displays the usual characteristics of mountaineers, fine physique and vigorous independent spirit; but its ancient truculence has given way before strong government action since the middle 10th century, and the great increase of agricultural pursuits, to which the purely pastoral are now quite secondary.
The independent tenure of the land by a vast number of small farmers, who are their own masters, gives an air of carelessness, almost of truculence, to the well-to-do Danish peasants.
!-------------------!

tryst => agreement between lovest to meet, rendez-vous
After this crime, which combined the disgrace of sacrilege with that of murder under tryst, Bruce was forced to take arms at once, though his preparations were incomplete.
The French failed to keep tryst, and De Ruyter was watched by Rupert, who was now in sole command, Monk having been recalled to London to take command amid the confusion caused by the fire and the plague.
!-------------------!

tumid => swollen, distended
The leaves, which are borne in pairs at the tumid nodes, are oval in form and have a Dicotyledonous type of venation.
There are some pleasing passages in Arnobius, but on the whole he is a tumid and a tedious author.
4 in.), the Yagans present in some respects a more debased type characterized by low brows, prominent zygomatic arches, large tumid lips, flat nose, loose wrinkled skin, black restless eyes very wide apart, coarse black unkempt hair, and head and chest disproportionately large compared with the extremely slender and outwardly curved legs.
!-------------------!

turbid => muddy, opaque, in a state of great confusion
She clung to it as an escape from the turbid waters below the surface of their conversation.
The water used may be turbid or clear, and it acts, not only for moistening the soil, but as manure.
This solution is not very stable, since on exposure to air it slowly oxidizes and becomes turbid owing to the gradual precipitation of sulphur.
!-------------------!

turgid => swollen, pompous
Cut plants are allowed to wilt, or become flaccid, before removal from the field, to prevent injury to the turgid leaves.
To a sluggish river turgid with sand in the S.
In addition to its usefulness in maintaining a turgid state of the young cells without which growth cannot proceed, water is itself a plant food-material and as absorbed from the soil contains dissolved in it all the mineral food constituents needed by plants for healthy nutrition.
!-------------------!

tutelary => serving as a guardian or protector
The Aeginetans at first contented themselves with sending the images of the Aeacidae, the tutelary heroes of their island.
The object of certain sacrifices is to provide a tutelary deity of a house, town or frontier.
(b) In parts of North America the nagual or manitu animal, of which the Indian dreams during the initiation fast and which is to be his tutelary spirit, is killed with certain rites.

The undulating swing of the coach finally rocked them to sleep, though.
Behind the lagoons an undulating plain stretches some 50 m.
!-------------------!

unfeigned => not false, genuine
Neither sect, it may be added, advocated sensuality pure and unfeigned - the Epicurean least of all.
The pure morality and simple-minded piety of this community seem early to have attracted Spinoza, and to have won his unfeigned respect.
On the other hand, there are in the book, in the description of Gargantua's and Pantagruel's education, in the sketch of the abbey of Thelema, in several passages relating to Pantagruel, expressions which either signify a sincere and unfeigned piety of a simple kind or else are inventions of the most detestable hypocrisy.
!-------------------!

untenable => indefensible
On the 21st of January Dr Saenz Pena at last perceived that his position was untenable, and he handed in his resignation.
And "reality," the current accounts of which it finds untenable or unmeaning.
None the less is the position in itself an untenable one and the parent of scepticism.
!-------------------!

untoward => not favorable, troublesome, unruly
In William's theory, the forcible conquest of England by strangers was an untoward accident.
This untoward disaster led to the abandonment of the expedition, which forthwith returned to Spain, bringing with them the news of the discovery of a fresh-water sea.
Per day in fine weather without any untoward incident.
!-------------------!

usury => a practice of lending money at exorbitant rates
Meantime much evil arises from usury in the poorer districts.
Restrictions on their occupations were everywhere common, and as the Church forbade Christians to engage in usury, this was the only trade open to the Jews.
But, as something can everywhere be made by the use of money, something ought everywhere to be paid for the use of it," and will in fact be paid for it; and the prohibition will only heighten the evil of usury by increasing the risk to the lender.
!-------------------!

vacillate => to waver, oscillate
Meantime much evil arises from usury in the poorer districts.
Restrictions on their occupations were everywhere common, and as the Church forbade Christians to engage in usury, this was the only trade open to the Jews.
But, as something can everywhere be made by the use of money, something ought everywhere to be paid for the use of it," and will in fact be paid for it; and the prohibition will only heighten the evil of usury by increasing the risk to the lender.
!-------------------!

vacuous => empty, void, lacking intelligence
If a long glass tube with plane ends, and containing some pellets of sodium is heated in the middle by a row of burners, the cool ends remain practically vacuous and do not become obscured.
Abney and Baker have shown that the pure dry chloride does not blacken when exposed in a vacuous tube to light, and that the blackening is due to absorption of oxygen accompanied by a loss of chlorine.
Fleming discovered that if the filament is made incandescent by the current from an insulated battery there is a unilateral conductivity of the rarefied gas between the hot filament and the metal plate, such that if the negative terminal of the filament is connected outside the lamp through a coil in which electric oscillations are created with the platinum plate, only one half of the oscillations are permitted to pass, viz., those which carry negative electricity from the hot filament to the cooled plate through the vacuous space.
!-------------------!

valedictory => pertaining to a farewell
At graduation he delivered the valedictory address for his class.
His valedictory thesis at the Ecole des Chartes, Serie chronologique des gardiens et seigneurs des Iles Normandes (1876), was a definitive work and but slightly affected by later research.
At the Ecole des Chartes, where his career was remarkably brilliant, his valedictory thesis was an Essai sur les revenus publics en Normandie au XII' siècle (1849), and it was to the history of his native province that he devoted his early works.
!-------------------!

vapid => tasteless, dull
In working from early Dorian models they introduced refinements of their own, with the result that they produced beautiful, but somewhat vapid and academic types.
One of the two heads on this dated sheet may probably have been a study for the same St Bernard; it was used afterwards by some follower for a St Leonard in a stiff and vapid "Ascension of Christ," wrongly attributed to the master himself in the Berlin Museum.
3 Maccabees, although purporting to be an historical narrative, is really an animated, if somewhat vapid, piece of fiction written in Greek somewhere between ioo B.C. and A.D.

vendetta => prolonged feud marked by bitter hostility
They had all along maintained a virtual independence of the Turks and until quite recently retained their medieval customs, living in fortified towers and practising the vendetta or blood-feud.
The vendetta, too, is now hardly ever heard of.
This hostility, which amounted to a real vendetta, was based, not so much upon the foreign policy of its victim, his negotiation of the Armistice terms and the decisive influence which he exercised in securing the acceptance of the Treaty of Versailles; as upon his financial policy both as Finance Minister in 1919 and as the Democratic Catholic supporter and, it is said, the political adviser of the Catholic Chancellor of the Reich, Dr. Wirth, in the preparation in the summer of 1921 of a fresh scheme of taxation designed to impose new burdens upon capital and upon the prosperous landed interest.

He will be veracious only so long as the consequences are not seriously injurious.
What is put before us, whether by the senses or by the statements of others, is instinctively accepted as a veracious report, till experience has proved the i P oss P P P bility of deception.
How much of this is fabulous there seems no means at present of determining, but some of the statements are made by veracious travellers - D'Orbigny and Tschudi.
!-------------------!

verbose => wordy
The schools were extensive buildings attached to the temples, where from an early age boys and girls were taught by the priests to sweep the sanctuaries and keep up the sacred fires, to fast at proper seasons and draw blood for penance, and where they received moral teaching in long and verbose formulas.

!-------------------!

vertigo => dizziness
Vertigo is a frequent result of cerebellar injury: animals indicate it by their actions; patients describe it.
The particulars of his case have been investigated by Dr Bucknill and Sir William Wilde, who have proved that he suffered from nothing that could be called mental derangement until the "labyrinthine vertigo" from which he had suffered all his life, and which he erroneously attributed to a surfeit of fruit, produced paralysis, "a symptom of which was the not uncommon one of aphasia, or the automatic utterance of words ungoverned by intention.

!-------------------!

virtuoso => someone with master skills, expert musician
See also a good description of the style of playing of the virtuoso J.
As virtuoso he held his own for the entire period during which he chose to appear in public; but the militant conductor and prophet of Wagner had a hard time of it, and the composer's place is still in dispute.
His appeal to musicians was made in a threefold capacity, and we have, therefore, to deal with Liszt the unrivalled pianoforte virtuoso (1830 - r848); Liszt the conductor of the "music of the future " at Weimar, the teacher of Tausig, Billow and a host of lesser pianists, the eloquent writer on music and musicians, the champion of Berlioz and Wagner (1848-1861); and Liszt the prolific composer, who for some five-and-thirty years continued to put forth pianoforte pieces, songs, symphonic orchestral pieces, cantatas, masses, psalms and oratorios (1847-1882).

5) Wade and Davis published in the New York Tribune the famous "Wade-Davis Manifesto," a vituperative document impugning the President's honesty of purpose and attacking his leadership.

The earth, or other planet, does not actually move round the sun; yet it is carried round the sun in the subtle matter of the great vortex, where it lies in equilibrium, - carried like the passenger in a boat, who may cross the sea and yet not rise from his berth.
!-------------------!

warranted => justified
The conclusion, then, which seems warranted by the evidence, is that the acolyte was an office only at Rome, and, becoming an order in the Gallican Church, found its way as such into the Roman books at some period before the fusion of the two rites under Charlemagne.
The Federalist Party, which may be regarded as definitely organized practically from 1791, was led, leaving Washington aside, by Alexander Hamilton and John Adams. A nationalization of the new central government to the full extent warranted by a broad construction of the powers granted to it by the constitution, and a correspondingly strict construction of the powers reserved to the states and the citizens, were the basic principles of Hamilton's policy.
For several years the Anti-Federalists or Republicans had contended that the administration at Washington had been exercising powers not warranted by the constitution, and when Congress had passed the alien and sedition laws the leaders of that party seized upon the event as a proper occasion for a spirited public protest which took shape principally in resolutions passed by the legislatures of Kentucky and Virginia.

zealot => one who is fanatically devoted to a cause
The failure of Jaureguy did not deter a young Catholic zealot, by name Balthazar Gerard, from attempting to assassinate the man whom he looked upon as the arch-enemy of God and the king.
Laud was a prodigy of parts and learning over whose tomb Art and Genius still continued to weep. Hampden deserved no more honourable name than that of the "zealot of rebellion."
